# CDMD-Randomizer

CDMD Randomizer is an app designed to help the user select a character, scenario and Old One when playing a game of Cthulhu: Death May Die. 

Since there is so much content (with more on the way), figuring out a unique scenario setup can be overwhelming. This app solves that problem for those 
brave enough to let fate take the wheel for a bit.
